  fullscreen: true                # default false
    # if you dont want to hide notif bar, for android just set this to false,
    # but for ios, add this to your flutter main():
    # WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    # SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIMode(SystemUiMode.manual, overlays: [SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top], );

  #! extra note for IOS:
  # If you have changed the name(s) of your info.plist file(s), you can specify the filename(s)

  #info_plist_files:
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Debug.plist'
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Release.plist'
